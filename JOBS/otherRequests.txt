Subject: website notes:

The overall information heirarchy is pretty flat. I think the overall idea is to create more flow - the headlines as the introduction, the descriptive paragraphs as context, and the speakers/agenda/day as the real meat. To this end, I'd suggest trying the following:

- Instead of the 2 separate colour blocks, unite the descriptive text with the headlines by putting it on the same kind of translucency. You might also try a 2-column layout rather than full-width. Definitely, whatever else, the whole of the descriptive text (2 long paragraphs & 1 short) needs to feel like a single unit of text, providing the bridge between what's above it and what's below it.

- I'd try making the speakers & agenda sections 2/3 instead of full-width. Right now it feels like everything's at the same level of importance, which makes it a little overwhelming scrolling through. I do like the grid layout very much though!

- the agenda also feels way too big, and even kind of unnecessary as it doesn't really convey anything the speakers section hasn't already given. I'd suggest either making it *way* smaller or even possibly removing it for now. I know a few organisers who don't distribute an agenda at all, but rather keep things a surprise so people turn up for the whole day. On the other hand, we have discussed some rather interesting non-keynote formats which might help to sell the event... maybe the way to go would be to highlight those (e.g. as 'format highlights' at the bottom of the speakers section)?

- the calls to action (subscribe, twitter, facebook, etc.) should be far higher up - maybe even anchored to the top nav? The text in the nav bar could be reduced a little to make room for that. Speaking of which, the top nav bar should be anchored!

- I'd lose the yellow and maybe freshen up the green a little - the purple is nice, but you might want to get a third opinion from someone who's a little more conservative. ;)

Hope that helps! I'll have a quick scout round for photos.
