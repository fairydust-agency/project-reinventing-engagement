          What is more important than engagement?

          ·      Deeper connections with customers
          ·      Better understanding of audiences
          ·      More sustainable working habits

          Developing meaningful relationships – with customers, audiences and internal staff – lies at the heart of any business’ success. And relationships are built on engagement. Reinventing Engagement brings together business leaders, entrepreneurs, commercial directors, creative agencies, and experts to share insights and actively learn  how to create the mutually beneficial engagements that underpin sustainable, lasting relationships with customers and employees.

          Our speakers will delve into the worlds of psychology, design and behavioural science to illuminate what truly moves people through the cycle of desire, fulfilment and eventually habit, and how these insights can benefit any business whose products or services benefit from repeat customer engagement.  Whether you’re looking to design a new offering or revamp an existing one, or to be inspired by ways to make your own organisation run more smoothly and effectively, this event is for you.
