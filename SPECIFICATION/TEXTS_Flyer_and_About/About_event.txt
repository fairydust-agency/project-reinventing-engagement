ABOUT EVENT (below the landing page picture)

What is more important than engagement?

·      More sustainable working habits
·      Deeper connections with customers
·      Better understanding of audiences
 
Developing meaningful relationships – with customers, audiences and internal staff – lies at the heart of any business’ success. And relationships are built on engagement. Reinventing Engagement brings together business leaders, entrepreneurs, commercial directors, creative agencies, and experts to share insights and actively learn  how to create the mutually beneficial engagements that underpin sustainable, lasting relationships with customers and employees.
 
Our speakers will delve into the worlds of psychology, design and behavioural science to illuminate what truly moves people through the cycle of desire, fulfilment and eventually habit, and how these insights can benefit any business whose products or services benefit from repeat customer engagement.  Whether you’re looking to design a new offering or revamp an existing one, or to be inspired by ways to make your own organisation run more smoothly and effectively, this event is for you.
 
The innovative format of this new event includes hands-on opportunities to put these ideas into practice, working with the speakers themselves.
